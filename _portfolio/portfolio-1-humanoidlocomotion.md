This piece of research is part of my master thesis and collaborative work with a group of researchers on an adult-sized humanoid robot. It is about biped locomotion planning with the popular inverted-pendulum-like model. The motion was validated in dynamics simulation based on an ancient engine [ODE](http://www.ode.org/), before performing the test on the real robot (a big guy with a height of 1.90m!). The gait was conservative and quite static due to the hardware control difficulties by then, but it was really a fun to see math worked and the robot walked as commanded.
