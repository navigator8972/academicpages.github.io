Improving data efficiency is one of the central challenges in robot learning because task examples and demonstrations are often expensive to acquire. One way to enable robots to learn from limited data is to employ domain priors. To effectively represent and incorporate these priors, this research explores approaches based on latent variables. The introduction of latent variables allows for a low-dimensional representation of task data and enforced structures, alleviating computational challenges in dealing with raw sensory data. Latent variables can also be used as a flexible intermediate representation to retain and transfer some useful structures to a target task. Lastly, with a prior design, latent variables might correlate the raw data to some intepretable values, or even abstract concepts to represent quite general model priors.
