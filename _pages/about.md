I am a post-docotoral researcher at the [Robotics, Perception and Learning Group](https://www.kth.se/rpl), KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
My role in the group is co-leading the research direction of deformable object manipulation by co-supervising PhD students and doing my own research. The interests lie in the intersection of robotics and machine learning. I am enthusiastic about finding and integrating problem structures, such as task representation, dynamical systems and optimization-based control, to facilitate learning-based robotics. I believe this would be a promising path towards greater robot autonomy and intelligence, which are necessary for robots to closely serve or work with humans. 


I obtained my PhD from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and [IST, University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) under the supervision of Prof. [Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671), Prof. [Ana Paiva](https://ana-paiva.com/) and Prof. [Francisco S. Melo](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/~fmelo/). Prior to that, I completed my master and bachelor study in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also worked as a software engineer in Siemens.
